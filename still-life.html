				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p>This project was my very first sketch using the p5.js editor. I was directly inspired by a scene in
					my room. The first challenge was to recreate the still-life within the editor. Unlike usual
					illustration software, you have to indicate the x and y values to draw and place objects. The second
					challenge was to animate the still image. It was an interesting experience to be directly inspired
					by the physical space which led me to capture the natural light movement and the parallax effect.

				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>Move your mouse across the illustration to experience the parallax effect. Once the day turns to
					night,
					you can hit "reset."</p>
