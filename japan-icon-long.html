				<h4>Icons for Japanese Culture</h4>
				<p>The four icons represent four important aspects of Japanese culture and the environment in which I
					grew up.</p>

				<h4>Project Task</h4>
				<p>The project guidelines were to design four original informational icons. The icons must have a
					cohesive design. I first chose to create icons on the topic of "Environment" and later decided to
					focus on my living environment in Tokyo where I grew up.<br><br>Having lived in the United States
					since 2016, I have experienced two very different cultures. Although I admire and appreciate some
					aspects of the culture in the United States, this experience allowed me to look back at my home
					country and appreciate its environment even more.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="work">
				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p>I divided the four important aspects of Japanese culture into transportation and safety, food and
					community, architecture and nature, and clean public spaces.<br><br>Through sketching the icons, I
					challenged myself to use various perspectives and shapes to create a more dynamic icon. In this way,
					I was able to utilize my knowledge and skills as an illustrator.</p>

					<figcaption>The final design became a combination of my sketches where I would take the overall
						shape of the circle but implement previous illustrative elements.</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</section>

			<section class="work">
				<h4>Iterations</h4>
				<p>Once I finalized my sketches, I illustrated them in Adobe Illustrator. The consistency is achieved
					through the circle frame, consistent line width, and simplified illustrations with curved edges. The
					final iteration was achieved through notes by my team members.</p>

				<h4>Details</h4>
				<p>The vector icons were illustrated and colored in Adobe Illustrator. I would use the Edit Color tool
					to go back and forth with color options. The illustrations are simple so that the information is
					clear. Every element in the icon is illustrated to add to the narrative instead of distracting from
					it.</p>

				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>Overall the icon has a cohesive design while expressing a variety of narratives. By limiting the
					color palette and the line expressions, the icons can exist in the same visual world. It was
					interesting to play with the push and pull of elements to best tell the narrative. Even though these
					are simple illustrations that seem familiar, they hold specific elements of my style of design that
					give them a playful look.<br><br>These key aspects of Japanese cultures are mainly of my personal
					experience and highlights. All of the introduced topics have played a large role in my upbringing in
					Japan. Although it is something that I had taken for granted, traveling and comparing cultures have
					given me a further appreciation towards those characteristics.</p>
