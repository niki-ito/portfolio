				<h4>Project Task</h4>
				<p>The task was to create an artist's biography website that includes four sections with a consistent
					design with varying information and presentation.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="work">
				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p>Although I took a lot of inspiration from the filmmaker's website, I wanted this website to relate
					more to her film titled "The Coin." I decided to create a circular window on the landing page which
					features the title and a still from the film to have a greater impact while relating simple shapes
					to the story.<br><br>I decided to divide the four sections into the story(synopsis), process(behind
					the scenes), sketch(storyboarding), and about the director. I decided to design my icons to create a
					consistent look while adding unique touches for this project.</p>

					<figcaption>This wireframe sketch includes a responsive design for mobile and desktop. Overall, the
						structure is a simple one column for mobile and two columns for desktop.</figcaption>

			<section class="work">
				<p>I used Sublime Text to code the website. I would create a linked CSS stylesheet to organize my code.
					Often I would look back on my notes to remember the specific code. My coding process consists of a
					constant back and forth with my code, my notes, and the browser for when I decide to use codes that
					I have yet to learn.</p>

				<h4>Details</h4>
				<p>I designed the website to be clean and simple while utilizing personal design elements and
					complementary shapes to give this project its unique quality.<br><br>Throughout the website, I have
					used simple color schemes and recurring shapes of thin lines and curved edges.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="work">
				<figure><img class="largeImage" src="assets/project2/images/detail.png">
					<figcaption>The design first started with the circular window of the landing page and later created
						icons. The circle shape is also used for the background of the icons and the curve extends to
						the edges of the bordered paragraphs. The line quality of the icons is also mirrored in the
						border of the circular window as well as the border for the paragraph.</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</section>

			<section class="work">
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>The website successfully captures the calm yet a dynamic feeling of the stop motion film. The
					director's characters have such strong qualities that the minimal design of the website lets her
					stills speak from themselves.<br><br>Overall, this project went smoothly from wireframing to coding.
					The wireframes help significantly when creating a unique yet organized design where I was able to
					freely create shapes and make visual relationships throughout the elements. It was such a fun
					experience to have my mock-up turn into a website that I could share and interact with.</p>
